    <h1>Part 1: Selfie: The Wrong Way vs. The Right Way</h1>
    <p>
        When you take a photo up close with a wide-angle lens, perspective distortion exaggerates the size of features closer to the camera, 
        such as the nose, while shrinking features that are farther away, like the ears. 
        This makes the face look distorted.
        By stepping back and zooming in with a longer focal length, you reduce this distortion: 
        the relative distances between facial features become less noticeable, 
        so the proportions look more natural and closer to how we perceive someone in real life.
    </p>

    <h1>Part 2: Architectural Perspective Compression</h1>
    <p>
        When you use a long focal length and shoot from far away, the angle of view is narrower and the relative differences in distance between objects become less pronounced. As a result, background elements appear closer to foreground elements, making the scene look “compressed.” On the other hand, when you shoot with a wide-angle lens from up close, the camera exaggerates perspective: objects nearer to the camera look much larger and those farther away look much smaller, so the sense of depth is stretched. This is why the two photos of the same scene can look so different even if the main subject stays about the same size.
